  Analyze the provided resume information for a candidate applying for the [Job Role] in the [Domain] domain. Evaluate the resume based on the following criteria:

  1. **Relevance to Job Role:** How well does the resume align with the target job role and domain?  Consider the match between skills, experience, and job requirements.
  2. **Strengths:** Identify the strongest aspects of the resume. What makes the candidate stand out?
  3. **Weaknesses:** Point out areas for improvement. Are there any missing skills, gaps in experience, or poorly written sections?
  4. **Actionable Suggestions:** Provide specific, actionable suggestions to improve the resume.  Focus on wording, structure, and content.  Examples:
    - "Quantify achievements whenever possible. Instead of 'Managed social media accounts,' write 'Increased social media engagement by 20% in six months.'"
    - "Tailor the summary/objective to the specific job role. Highlight relevant skills and experience."
    - "Use action verbs to describe responsibilities in the work experience section."
